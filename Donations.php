<p>
    KXStudio is and always will be a free and open-source project to everyone.<br/>
    Donations help ensure that developers have the needed enthusiasm and motivation to keep working on the project.<br/>
    Just because we're open-source doesn't mean we're allergic to money. ;)
</p>

<p>
    <b>The KXStudio project is no longer taking donations.</b>
</p>

<p>
    In German law donations count as income and thus have to be taxed.<br/>
    It came to the point where it was more expensive for the project to have them rather than not.<br/>
    As such, donations have been taken down for now.<br/>
    They might come back at a later time, when the (single) KXStudio developer relocates to another country.

    Thanks for understanding.
